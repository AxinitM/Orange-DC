### The task and my comments

Creating a 404 page.

My comments:

- users will see this page when they go to the missing/deleted/lost page of the bar/restaurant website etc.;
- image is made as a background;
- navigation menu is "glued" to the top of the page;
- when hovering the cursor over the menu items, they turn green;
- the photo is used under a free license from Freepik (the license is located in /image);
- the page is not optimized for mobile screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- vanilla CSS;
- Flexbox.

### What I learned

This task improved my knowledge in HTML (semantic code, etc.), CSS (flexbox, background-image, nesting etc.).
