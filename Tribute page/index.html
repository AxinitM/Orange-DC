          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            <strong class="highlight">Henry Ford</strong> was born on July 30,
            1863, in Greenfield Township, Michigan. He grew up on a farm but was
            deeply interested in mechanics from a young age. Ford's journey into
            the automotive industry began when he worked as an engineer at the
            Edison Illuminating Company in Detroit. In 1896, he built his first
            car, the Quadricycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ford's most significant contribution was car
            <strong class="highlight">the Model T</strong>, introduced in 1908.
            The Model T changed transportation and became the first affordable
            car for many people. This success was due to Ford's new
            manufacturing methods - the moving assembly line.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong class="highlight">The moving assembly line</strong> is a
            revolutionary manufacturing method that forever changed industry
            standards. This innovation allowed Ford Motor Company to drastically
            reduce the time it took to assemble a car from more than 12 hours to
            about 90 minutes. By breaking down the production process into
            sequential steps and assigning each worker a specific task, Ford was
            able to achieve unprecedented efficiency and consistency in
            manufacturing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The impact of the assembly line extended far beyond the automotive
            industry. It laid
            <strong class="highlight"
              >the foundation for modern industrial production methods</strong
            >, transforming how goods are manufactured across various sectors.
            The principles of assembly line production introduced by Ford became
            the cornerstone of mass production, influencing industries ranging
            from electronics to aerospace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today,
            <strong class="highlight"
              >everything from household appliances to complex machinery
            </strong>
            is produced using principles derived from Ford's assembly line. This
            method not only increased productivity and lowered costs but also
            enabled the mass production of standardized goods. As a result,
            products became more affordable and accessible to consumers
            worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The assembly line also
            <strong class="highlight"
              >revolutionized labor practices and workforce management</strong
            >. It created new job opportunities and spurred economic growth by
            increasing production capacity and meeting rising consumer demand.
            However, it also led to debates about its impact on worker
            satisfaction, automation, and the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ford also made many
            <strong class="highlight">important inventions</strong>. These
            included improvements to car engines, the development of mass
            production techniques, and innovations in industrial management. His
            work helped shape the modern automotive industry.

            <p>
              <strong class="highlight"
                >Pioneer of Assembly Line Production:</strong
              >
              Ford revolutionized the automotive industry by introducing the
              moving assembly line in 1913. This innovation drastically reduced
              the time it took to build a car, making automobiles affordable for
              the average American. The Model T's price dropped significantly,
              and by 1927, over 15 million units had been produced.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong class="highlight">Doubled the hourly salary:</strong> in
              1914, Ford doubled the daily wage of his factory workers to $5
              (about $140 in 2024), a move that shocked the industrial world.
              This not only reduced employee turnover and increased
              productivity, but also allowed workers to afford the cars they
              were building, thereby creating a larger market for his products.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong class="highlight">Philanthropy and Education:</strong>
              Ford was a philanthropist who invested heavily in education and
              the arts. He founded the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, the Ford
              Foundation, and Greenfield Village and the Henry Ford Museum in
              Dearborn, Michigan, to preserve American history and innovation.

            <h3>Fakes</h3>
            <p>
              <strong class="highlight">Ford Invented the Automobile:</strong>
              contrary to popular belief, Ford did not invent the automobile.
              The first practical automobile is credited to Karl Benz in 1885,
              named Mercedes. Ford's contribution was in making the automobile
              affordable and accessible to the masses through his innovative
              production techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong class="highlight">Anti-Semitic Allegations:</strong> while
              it is true that Ford published anti-Semitic articles in his
              newspaper, "The Dearborn Independent," but it is a myth that these
              views defined his entire legacy. Later in life, Ford publicly
              apologized for the articles, and the Ford Motor Company has since
              actively supported Jewish communities and causes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong class="highlight">Ford was Against Unions:</strong> there
              is a common belief that Ford was universally opposed to labor
              unions. While he did resist unionization in his factories for many
              years, it is not true that he never cooperated with unions. In
              1941, after a long struggle, Ford Motor Company signed its first
              contract with the United Auto Workers, marking a significant shift
              in labor relations.

          <h2>Funny stories</h2>
          <p>
            Henry Ford's life was filled with remarkable achievements,
            interesting endeavors, and humorous moments. These are just a few of
            the stories that have come down to us.
            <strong class="highlight"
              >No one knows which of these stories are true and which are urban
              legends</strong

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="highlight">Testing Cars in Disguise:</strong> Henry
            Ford was known for testing his cars personally. To avoid recognition
            and get honest feedback, he would often wear disguises. On one
            occasion, he dressed as a common worker and visited a local
            dealership to hear what customers thought of his latest model.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="highlight">The Soap Incident:</strong> Ford was quite
            meticulous about cleanliness in his factories. It's said that he
            once caught an employee not washing his hands properly. Ford then
            placed a bar of soap in the employee's locker with a note saying,
            "Use it!"
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="highlight">The Stubborn Goat:</strong> during the
            early days of Ford Motor Company, a goat wandered into the factory
            and refused to leave. Ford, amused by the situation, named the goat
            "Mr. Muggins" and allowed it to stay. The goat became a sort of
            unofficial mascot and was often seen wandering around the assembly
            line.
