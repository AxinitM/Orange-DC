## The task and the page description

Creating a page dedicated to a famous person (tribute page).

Page description:
- footer is «glued» to the bottom of the visible area and it is always visible to the user; 
- the photos (Inventions section) are doubled when the cursor is hovered over;
- the footer contains two buttons that change color to green when the cursor is hovered over them. When clicking on them - the user goes to the top of the page;
- the top menu (header) is created with < ol > and < il >, but the bottom menu (footer) is created with flexbox and < p >. This was my experiment and testing the performance of each variant.
