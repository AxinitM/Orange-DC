## Calendar Page Code Description

This code creates a web page with a calendar that automatically adapts to different screen sizes thanks to the use of media queries and flexible layout. When hovering over a date in the current month, a green circular border appears around the date, and the date turns dark green. When hovering over dates from the previous or next month, a red border appears around them.
