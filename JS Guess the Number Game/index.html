              <h3>Rules Of The Game</h3>
              <p>The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 20.</p>
              <p>
                The player's goal is to guess the number with the fewest
                possible attempts.
              </p>
              <p>
                The player has 20 attempts. The remaining number of attempts is
                displayed in the "Score" section.
              </p>
              <p>
                After entering a number, the player can check their guess by
                pressing the "Check" button or the "Enter" key.
              </p>
              <p>
                After each guess, the computer will indicate whether the correct
                number is higher, lower, or if the guess is correct.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entering numbers outside the range of 1 to 20 is considered an
                error and counts as an attempt.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the player guesses correctly, the game will congratulate
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the player doesn't guess the number within 20 attempts, they
                lose the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                The correct number will be displayed in the center square
                instead of the "?" symbol at the end of the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the game, the player can click the "Try Again!" button to
                restart.
              </p>
              <p>Have fun and enjoy the game!</p>
